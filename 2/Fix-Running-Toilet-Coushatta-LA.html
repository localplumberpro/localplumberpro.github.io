<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
