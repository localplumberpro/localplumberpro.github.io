<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
