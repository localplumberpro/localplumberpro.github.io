<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water solidity, among the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Hard water destroys appliances, leaves filmy soap scum throughout bathrooms and cooking areas, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States depending on hard water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve a vital function.

<p>First and foremost, never plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near to your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your home to the city line.) You may have an idea of where your lateral is situated if you have had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to prevent. Your line will be easy to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
