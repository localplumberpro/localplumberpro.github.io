<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
