<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall be applicable to small repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings aside from Group R-3 tenancies, a license and inspection will be required for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor area, level, or wing is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
