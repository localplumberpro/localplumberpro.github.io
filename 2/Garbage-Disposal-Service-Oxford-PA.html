<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the right water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space since the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance solidity removal you can count on for many years to come.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
