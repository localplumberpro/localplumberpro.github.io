<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
