In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has become a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
