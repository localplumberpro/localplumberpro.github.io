The steps for changing a lp water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Repeating leakages and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.
