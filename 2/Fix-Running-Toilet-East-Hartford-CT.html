<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor East Hartford CT</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the brine service into the softener tank and the ion exchange procedure occurs once again, just this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.
