<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is an essential kitchen appliance in the majority of homes today. While most kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being ineffective, increasing the danger of drain blockages.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
