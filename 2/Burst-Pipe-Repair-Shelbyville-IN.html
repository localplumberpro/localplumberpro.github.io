A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
