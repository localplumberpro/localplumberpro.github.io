<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the house resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy.

Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE economical than mold removal or changing flooring or drywall! So we recommend installing or fixing water pressure regulators to secure your whole home.</p>
