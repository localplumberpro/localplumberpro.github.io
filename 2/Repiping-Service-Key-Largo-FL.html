When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener.

As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
