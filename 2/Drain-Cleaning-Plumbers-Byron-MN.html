<p>Your house's drains and pipes quietly get rid of thousands of gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even providing a doubt.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
