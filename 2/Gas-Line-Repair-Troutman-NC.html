<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Troutman NC</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
