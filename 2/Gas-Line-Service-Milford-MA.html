<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Milford MA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
