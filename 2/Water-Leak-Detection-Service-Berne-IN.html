<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
