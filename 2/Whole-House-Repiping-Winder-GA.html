<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
