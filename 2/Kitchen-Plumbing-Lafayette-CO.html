    <meta name="description" content="Certified Plumber Companies Lafayette Colorado - Our faucet came with hot and cold water lines, and we got the silencing kit with our SHURFLO water pump, so we already had most of the components we needed for our very simple plumbing set up. The only complicated part was splitting the output from the pump to go to both the cold water line straight to the faucet and to the water heater before it went to the hot water line of the faucet.">

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
