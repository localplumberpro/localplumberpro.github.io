<p>2 designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve.

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance.
