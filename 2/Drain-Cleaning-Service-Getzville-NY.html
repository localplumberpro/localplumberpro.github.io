<p>Thank you a lot for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had actually been on getaway during the time of repair and it was comforting to know it had been taken care of and ready to go upon our return.

<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin.
