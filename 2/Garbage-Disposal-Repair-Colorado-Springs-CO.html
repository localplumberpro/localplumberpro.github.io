<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Colorado Springs CO</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Also note that backflow prevention is needed when required, along with inspection of the device to ensure it's working effectively. At Home Service Doctors, our Sewerologists have years of sewer repair and replacement experience under our belts. Often issues with your sewer line are easy to repair, however we have found out that there are specific situations where complete replacement is merely the best alternative.</p>
