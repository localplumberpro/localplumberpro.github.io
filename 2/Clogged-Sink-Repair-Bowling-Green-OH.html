<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
