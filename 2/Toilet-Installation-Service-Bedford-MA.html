<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Bedford MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
