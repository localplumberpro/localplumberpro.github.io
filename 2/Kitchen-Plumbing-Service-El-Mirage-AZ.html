<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
