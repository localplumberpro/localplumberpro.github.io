<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

The integrated water and space heaters are a efficient and effective option that can be used to warm up your home as well as heat water for domestic purposes.</p>
