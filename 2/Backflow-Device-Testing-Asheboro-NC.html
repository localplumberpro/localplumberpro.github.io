<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. It is important that only initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
