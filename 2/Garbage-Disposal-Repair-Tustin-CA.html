<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
