<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Seneca SC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine beneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in new houses, but lots of houses constructed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When discovered and replaced with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
