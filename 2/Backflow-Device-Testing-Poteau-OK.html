<p>No other room in a house contains as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have cleaned and checked the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the elements to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the appropriate place. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or accidentally positioned in the body. The elements should be placed so that the guides are able to keep their designed tolerances.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
