<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
