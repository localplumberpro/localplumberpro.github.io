Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both harmless to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at getting rid of grime, waste, and natural material that so often congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem.

<p>In addition to clearing your drains, we also offer total drain repair services. Everyone understands the inconvenience and mess that accompanies a sluggish drain. Even so, lots of people wait until the drain stops totally before they take corrective action. Call us before your problems get this bad. We promise it'll conserve you money and time in the long run.</p>

Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
