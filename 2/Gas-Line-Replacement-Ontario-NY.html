<p>Primarily, never ever plant anything up against your home, in front of windows, nor close to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your home to the city line.) You might have a concept of where your lateral is located if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or perhaps go into and break the line. If you are hiring someone to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the areas to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to recognize.</p>
