If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
