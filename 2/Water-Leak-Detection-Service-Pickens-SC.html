Due to the fact that of the tight area, the pipes often make strange gurgling noises as water efforts to go through a clogged pipe.

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low.
