<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>

Then they are changed in the option by the salt ions.</p>
