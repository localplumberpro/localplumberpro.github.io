<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Park Hills MO</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leaks. If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting option.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may require a little different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
