<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Powder Springs GA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leakages. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however many houses constructed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and changed with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
