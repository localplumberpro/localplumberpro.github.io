<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
