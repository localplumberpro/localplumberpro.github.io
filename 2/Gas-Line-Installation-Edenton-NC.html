<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Edenton NC</h3>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable service, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
