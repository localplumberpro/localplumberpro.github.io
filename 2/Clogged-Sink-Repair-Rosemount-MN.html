<p>The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
