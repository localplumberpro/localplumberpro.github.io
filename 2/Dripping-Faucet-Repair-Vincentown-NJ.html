<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be tough to spot and can also harm your residential or commercial property. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health danger and frequently go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations. Because the source of leaking water can be difficult to discover, our plumbers often perform a dye test to identify the source. Typically, pipes or water service lines are changed, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly dirty or blemished and often gets mistaken for a water supply line leak.</p>
