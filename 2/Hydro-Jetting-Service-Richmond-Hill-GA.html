<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
