<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common enough that many individuals opt for do-it-yourself repairs. But sometimes even determining the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
