<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from corrosion and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your house.
