<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Hazlehurst MS</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
