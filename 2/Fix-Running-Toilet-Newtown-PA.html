<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any circumstance that may require a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your business, they can cause monetary losses and in some instances can stop your service totally. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little office the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can cause major problems.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Blockages that continue after you have actually tried to repair them call for professional support. Continued attempts on your own can damage your lines, and you may have a more major underlying problem than you are aware of. Additionally, the longer you postpone to call for professional assistance, the higher the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
