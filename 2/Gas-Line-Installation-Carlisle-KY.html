<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the home. Typically, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water begins flowing out with a yellowish, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping job needs to be in your near future.
