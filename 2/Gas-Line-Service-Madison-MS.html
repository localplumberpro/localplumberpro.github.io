<p>This post aims to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated truths that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first attempt pouring BioSmart (available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inaccessible or inadequate cleanouts: No matter how efficient a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time. Property owners and plumbers must be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this takes place. Structures without enough cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>
