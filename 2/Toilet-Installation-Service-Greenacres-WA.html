<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>
