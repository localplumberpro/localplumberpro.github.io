<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
