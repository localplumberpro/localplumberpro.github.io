<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing service.

The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position.
