But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
