<p>Leakages are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
