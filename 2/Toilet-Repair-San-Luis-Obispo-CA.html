<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In San Luis Obispo CA</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you pick must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed should have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line during installation. Fewer parts in the system result in fewer tankless water heater repair visits.</p>
