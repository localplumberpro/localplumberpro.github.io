<p>Two styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be used to separate health or non-health threats however works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had numerous plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Deterioration can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The effect of corrosion on a metal alloy should be evaluated to identify if the part is usable or must be replaced.</p>
<p>Since water contamination could posture a serious public health risk, local laws need yearly inspections to guarantee your backflow prevention devices are working as they must be. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that break in time and it is necessary that they receivethe same regular maintenance that your car or HEATING AND COOLING system gets to ensure your household's water is safe & clean.</p>
