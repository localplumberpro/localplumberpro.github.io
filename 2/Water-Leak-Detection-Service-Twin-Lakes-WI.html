<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>

<p>This short article intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated facts that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically destructive. Therefore, softened water must likewise be corrosive, ideal? This is a misconception due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
