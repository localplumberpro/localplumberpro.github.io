Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

The pre-programmed number represents the quantity of time between each regeneration. For example, a lower chosen number suggests your softener will regrow less typically.

Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
