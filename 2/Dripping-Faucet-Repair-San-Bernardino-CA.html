<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load.
