<p>Leaks are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
