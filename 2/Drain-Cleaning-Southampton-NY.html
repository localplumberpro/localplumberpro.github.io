<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
