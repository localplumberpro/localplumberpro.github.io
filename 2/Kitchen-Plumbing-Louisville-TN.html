<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Louisville TN 37777</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
