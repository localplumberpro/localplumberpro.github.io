<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust certification requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and rusted parts make repairs difficult and pricey, meaning a faucet installation is more rewarding.

If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
