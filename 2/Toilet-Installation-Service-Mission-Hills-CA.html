<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
