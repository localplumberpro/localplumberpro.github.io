<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include appliance wires connected, and others do not. If yours doesn't, get rid of the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the producer's directions. Most basic disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>

<p>Insects. Sadly, a damaged main sewer line can also result in unwanted pests inside your home.
