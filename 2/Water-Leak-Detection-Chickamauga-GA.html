<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater far from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home.

For around $40, you may choose to buy a push button package that permits a sink-top switch button to run your disposal. These sink switch kits are made to be quickly mounted 1, and will normally take your plumber less than an hour to install, at typical plumbing costs of approximately $45-$ 65 per hour.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will lead to decapitation, it might terrify a couple of years off your life.
