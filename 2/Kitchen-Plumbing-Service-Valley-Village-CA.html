<p>The usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
