<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
