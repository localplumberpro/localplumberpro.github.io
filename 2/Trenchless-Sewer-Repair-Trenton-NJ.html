Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
