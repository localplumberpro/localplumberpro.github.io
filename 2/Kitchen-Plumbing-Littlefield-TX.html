<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention options, but they also supply the least amount of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc increases and seals off the air inlet.</p>

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
