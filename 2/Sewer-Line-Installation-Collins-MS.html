<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there could be a fracture in the porcelain, either the tank or the toilet bowl itself.

We can repair a leaking or running  toilet, or we can replace a whole toilet within hours instead of days so that you experience the least quantity of disturbance in your life.</p>
