<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Many need for plumbers will come from new construction and the need to keep and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other buildings. Employment of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to constructing codes that require the use of fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
