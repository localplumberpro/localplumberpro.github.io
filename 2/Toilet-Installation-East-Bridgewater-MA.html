<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
