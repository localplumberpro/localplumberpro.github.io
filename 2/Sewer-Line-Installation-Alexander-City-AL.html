<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.

Many fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
