<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Chalfont Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>You may have heard stories about a warm water heater blowing up inside a home or service! It is essential to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into a hazardous time bomb. The age of your water heater. A traditional tank hot water heater usually lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with appropriate maintenance and care.
