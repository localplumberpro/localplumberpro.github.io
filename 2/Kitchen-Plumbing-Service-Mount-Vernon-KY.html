<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
