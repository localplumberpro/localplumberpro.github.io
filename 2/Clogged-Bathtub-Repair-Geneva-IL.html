<p>As soon as you've found the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.

Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
