<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly known as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to obtain consistency among the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the building's energy and water use; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
