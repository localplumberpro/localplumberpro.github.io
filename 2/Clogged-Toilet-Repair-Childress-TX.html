<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
