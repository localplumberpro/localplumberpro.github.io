<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water starts flowing out with a yellowish, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has actually built up in your pipes and a repiping job should remain in your future. State and local laws may affect the services this individually owned and run franchise location might perform at this time. Please get in touch with the franchise area for extra details.</p>
