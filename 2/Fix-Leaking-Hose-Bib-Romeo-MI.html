<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that counts on extremely technical expertise and customized devices to recognize the area of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the area of those leakages at which noticeable water may or may not have surfaced. Water temperature level concerns can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale development or corrosion. It is necessary that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and type of the various coverings used on iron body units so as not to damage the protective covering.</p>
