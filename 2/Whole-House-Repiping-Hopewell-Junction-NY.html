<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Hopewell Junction NY</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
