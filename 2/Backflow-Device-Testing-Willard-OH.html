Rather than dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
