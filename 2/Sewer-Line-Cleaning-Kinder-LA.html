<p>A newly installed hot water heater need to not produce unusual noises, however it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things aggravate considerably for households with a high demand for hot water.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
