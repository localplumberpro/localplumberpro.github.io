<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Generally, minerals get there since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can likewise be difficult to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined spaces. The best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much area and need a large swing angle, which may be difficult to obtain in small areas.</p>
