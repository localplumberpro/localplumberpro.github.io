<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
