<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually found the journey lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
