Discover more about the advantages of repiping your home by calling our Knoxville repiping plumbers at (865) 238-2280 today.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water firmness, one of the most typical water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water damages appliances, leaves filmy soap scum throughout kitchen areas and restrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on hard water for their bathing, cooking, and cleaning, water softeners serve a vital purpose. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely messed up water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener conserves you cash, energy, and time, and safeguards your home and your residential or commercial property.</p>
