<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to figure out the ideal water treatment for your house. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less space since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance hardness elimination you can count on for many years to come.</p>
