<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>
