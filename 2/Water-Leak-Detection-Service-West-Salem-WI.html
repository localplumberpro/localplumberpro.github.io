These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to remove.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back.
