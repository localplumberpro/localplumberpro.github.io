<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust areas, and use less detergent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are appropriate for washing makers, or you can try laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>In order to insure the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it must be checked and certified upon installation and at least when a year thereafter if installed to protect form a health threat scenario. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers supervise these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, use, or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested regularly to ensure that they are working correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
