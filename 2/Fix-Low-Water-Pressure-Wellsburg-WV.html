When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule.
