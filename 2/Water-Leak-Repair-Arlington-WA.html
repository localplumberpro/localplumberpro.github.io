<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
