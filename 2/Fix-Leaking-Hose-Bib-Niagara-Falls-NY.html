<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Niagara Falls NY 14304</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
