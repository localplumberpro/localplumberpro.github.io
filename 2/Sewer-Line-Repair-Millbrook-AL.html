<p>What makes softer water better water? Soft water leaves your hair and skin feeling soft after your early morning shower and can improve the taste of your drinking water.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
