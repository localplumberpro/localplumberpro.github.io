<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is created to attract corrosion-causing aspects in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from rusting. The very best method to avoid drain blockages is to see what you flush.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
