<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe in Jersey City NJ 07305</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Actually Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electric heating element, there is a good chance your pilot light has gone out.

No matter what the concern is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to work up until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
