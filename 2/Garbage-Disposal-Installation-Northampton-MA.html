<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are stating. Will also state something doesn't work well merely since they don't like the technology and not due to the fact that it doesn't work. If this heater is set up in a house with several restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>
