<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. However finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are often available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
