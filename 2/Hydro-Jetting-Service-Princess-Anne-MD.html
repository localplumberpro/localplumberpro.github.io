<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services in Princess Anne MD 21853</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
