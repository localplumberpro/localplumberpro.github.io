<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Dallastown</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwanted concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>B&I's plumbing department includes a professional team of licensed plumbers experienced in all elements of commercial and industrial plumbing. We have the resources and experience to take on any job, small or large. From pre-construction planning to post-completion follow up, our plumbing department offers quality installations at competitive rates.</p>
