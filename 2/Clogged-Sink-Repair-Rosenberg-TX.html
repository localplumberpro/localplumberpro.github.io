We can clear jams and help clients understand what they must not put down their disposals. Just how much does it cost to repipe a home with PEX? About the very same price, although you'll likely pay more since it's a more resilient, better quality product.

This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
