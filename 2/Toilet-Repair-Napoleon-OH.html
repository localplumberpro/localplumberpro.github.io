<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
