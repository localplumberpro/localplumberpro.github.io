<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate.
