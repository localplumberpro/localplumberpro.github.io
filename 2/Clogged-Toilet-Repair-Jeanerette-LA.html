If your disposal is frequently making sounds that are unusual for the machine, it might be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing completion of its life expectancy. Frequent blockages, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, might show an issue with the disposal. If there are leaks originating from your system, it is most likely due to excessive use over a long period of time. A lot of these leakages can be repaired, but if they end up being bigger and more frequent, you should think about overall system replacement.</p>
