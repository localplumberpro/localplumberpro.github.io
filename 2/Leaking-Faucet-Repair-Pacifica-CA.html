<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
