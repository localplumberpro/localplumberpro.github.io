<p>A waste disposal unit lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical life expectancy calculation assumes normal wear and tear of the unit. The lifespan of a garbage disposal might be lower in the case of neglect, overuse, and abuse of the disposal system. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation? Have a drain connection or other issue that requires a kitchen or bathroom sink repair?
