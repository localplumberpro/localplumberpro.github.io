<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
