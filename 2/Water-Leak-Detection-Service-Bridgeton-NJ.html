<p>Once you've found the trip lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you've secured the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
