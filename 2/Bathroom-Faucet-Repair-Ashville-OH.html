<p>Before setting up, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
