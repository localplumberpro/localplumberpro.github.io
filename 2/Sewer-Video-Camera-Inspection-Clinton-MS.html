<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Clinton MS</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether it is an electric hot water heater or a gas water heater, Premier Plumbing has actually offered hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978. From under the sink, slide the fiber gasket, backup flange and installing flange over the sink flange. Hold these pieces in place.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
