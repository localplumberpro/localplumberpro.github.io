<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Redding CA</h3>
<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
