<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Wapakoneta OH</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
