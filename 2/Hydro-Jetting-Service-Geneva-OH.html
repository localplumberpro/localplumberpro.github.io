<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
