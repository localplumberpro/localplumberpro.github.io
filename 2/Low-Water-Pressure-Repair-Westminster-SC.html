<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly should then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might lead to incorrect information on the operations of the backflow prevention assembly.

The effects of elevated temperature can also trigger excessive pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions must be recognized and their cause remedied. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
