<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your house.
