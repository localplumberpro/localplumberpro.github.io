<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, frequently called "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water use; reduce waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Since copper is revealing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
