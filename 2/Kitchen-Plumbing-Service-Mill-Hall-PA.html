<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Mill Hall PA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their tasks break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who deal with fundamental repairs (typically in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who concentrate on redesigning projects and additions.</p>
