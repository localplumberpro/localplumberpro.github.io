<p>Sinkholes don't just take place in your lawn, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your home's foundation, the very best you can expect is to discover rapidly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will trigger the foundation to move and develop fractures. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers along with structure repair experts.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
