<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate. Faulty Components: If your toilet will not stop running, it's most likely due to problems with a toilet tank part. In such cases, we are generally able to replace that single element.
