<p>A waste disposal unit resolves all of those problems, adding convenience. Just turn on water at the garbage and the sink disposal does the rest - and far more quietly than you believe. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals don't really use blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are quickly removed and became solid fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to lower the overall costs of treatment.</p>
