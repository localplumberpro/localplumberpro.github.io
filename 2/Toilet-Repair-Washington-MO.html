<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Washington MO</h3>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
