<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Saratoga Springs NY 12866? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home.

<p>Overall time 1 hour. Bought retail. Get the plumbers putty at purchase. Cut off dedicated power 1st. I followed nice detailed instructions. Saved over $300 on install chrgs in my Northern VA neighborhood. Excavation: If the pipe is difficult to access, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation costs. Make gas line connections from steel or copper pipes to clothes and varieties dryers safe and secure and safe by utilizing the appropriate fittings and connections. We reveal you how.</p>
