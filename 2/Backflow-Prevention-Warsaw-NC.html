<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, first try putting BioSmart (offered at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm water down the drain. Inadequate or unattainable cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually. Plumbers and homeowners need to be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this happens. Structures without enough cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at threat of a pipe bursting.</p>
