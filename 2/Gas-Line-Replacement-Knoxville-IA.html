<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly option.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain.
