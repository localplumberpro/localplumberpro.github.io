<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
