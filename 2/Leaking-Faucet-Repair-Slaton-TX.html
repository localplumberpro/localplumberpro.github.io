<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Corrosion can actually eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of deterioration on a metal alloy need to be assessed to determine if the part is functional or need to be changed.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
