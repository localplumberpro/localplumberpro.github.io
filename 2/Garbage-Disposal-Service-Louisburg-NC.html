<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Louisburg NC</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
