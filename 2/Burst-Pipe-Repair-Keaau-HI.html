<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a good balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the house and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last expenses.</p>
