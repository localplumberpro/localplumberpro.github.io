<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
