When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health threat if permitted to re-enter the water supply.
