<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Water staining: Another apparent sign of your pipes rotting is brown or yellow water coming out of your sinks or tub. Step 2: On the brand-new drain, apply plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into location. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving. If you require garbage disposal repair, we can also assist. Among our service technicians will come out to spot the issue and get your disposal operating in no time.</p>
