<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
