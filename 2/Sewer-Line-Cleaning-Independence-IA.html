<p>Hard water usage may impact the performance of household home appliances. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a shorter life span. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence affecting their efficiency.</p>
