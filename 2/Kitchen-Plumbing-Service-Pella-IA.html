<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line throughout installation. Fewer parts in the system lead to fewer tankless water heater repair visits.</p>
