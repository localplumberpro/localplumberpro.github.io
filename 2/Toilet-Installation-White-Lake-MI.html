<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to ruin micro-organisms and offer purified water.

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
