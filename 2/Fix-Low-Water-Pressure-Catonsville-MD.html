The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
