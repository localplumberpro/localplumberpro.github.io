A correctly running backflow assembly can help prevent this.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience clogs in several drains at once in your house, then that typically implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in several areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
