<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
