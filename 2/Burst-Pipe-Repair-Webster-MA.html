<p>Guaranteeing plumbing devices such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are separated to their own particular networks is crucial in order to maintain safe and clean water security.

Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be one of the most pricey repair tasks if ignored.
