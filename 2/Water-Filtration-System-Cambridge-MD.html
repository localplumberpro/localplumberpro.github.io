<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Cambridge MD</h3>
<p>Rather of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter professionals will drill simply a couple of holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it quickly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the best choice for your home or service.
