We had actually been on vacation during the time of repair and it was reassuring to understand it had been looked after and ready to go upon our return. For a plumber focusing on drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing created to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are appropriately tested by qualified workers.</p>
