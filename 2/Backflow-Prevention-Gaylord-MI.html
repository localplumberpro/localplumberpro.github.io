<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
