<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does occur more frequently than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
