<p>Upon making a high school diploma or GED, potential plumbing contractors need to start a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common way for plumbers to find out the abilities needed to become effective in the trade. Many apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor companies. Programs usually last 4 to 5 years and require apprentices to complete a particular variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
<p>After you have successfully completed the apprenticeship program, you are now eligible to get your own plumber license and be called licensed journeymen. During this phase, you can accept jobs and carry out plumbing tasks with no supervision. Though, keep in mind that you need to submit all required files, pay the fees required to the state licensing agency, and pass the exam before you end up being a licensed journeyman.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be remedied easily if the clog is simple and shallow. For most blockages you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, but if this does not solve the issue then you might likewise need to call in a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
