<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively get rid of large quantities of water and waste. With time, dirt, particles, hair, and countless other small particles can get caught and develop in your pipes. Eventually, the water may not be able to drain quickly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. When this occurs, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are tailored to your particular problem. Whether the clog is in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. The area of the drain is necessary due to the fact that it helps our plumbers to understand the kind of clog they might be handling. Shower drains typically get hair blockages, and kitchen sink drains are prone to grease blockages.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
