<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that normally suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can occur in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Generally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your daily regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building product as possible intact.</p>
