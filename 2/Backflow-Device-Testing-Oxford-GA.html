<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless device repair bills, you need a water softener. Hard water is not an issue that will go away on its own and the costs incurred by tough water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, appliances will inevitably stop working earlier than their anticipated life expectancy. Your flow rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Tough water devastations hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility expenses will continue to barrel skyward.

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the system falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
