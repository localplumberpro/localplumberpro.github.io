When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten up the drain locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
