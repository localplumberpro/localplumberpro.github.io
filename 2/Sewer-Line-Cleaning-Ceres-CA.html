The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water may have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these indications of rust, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
