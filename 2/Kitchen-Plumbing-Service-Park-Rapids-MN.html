<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, but they also offer the least amount of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc increases and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Just how much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments include specialized camera devices that faces your sewer line.
