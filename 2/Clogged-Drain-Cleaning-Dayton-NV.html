<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be remedied easily if the obstruction is basic and shallow. For many blockages you'll just need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not solve the problem then you might also have to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
