<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
