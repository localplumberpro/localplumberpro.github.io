<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>
