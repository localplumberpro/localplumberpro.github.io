<p>Liquid drain cleaner sold at your local home improvement huge box store can aid with a few things, however it's really quite limited in its ability to resolve problems inside your drains and it can be corrosive and destructive to many types of pipes. Unless you have a way to see inside the drain, there is likewise no assurance that drain cleaner is even going to be effective.

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
