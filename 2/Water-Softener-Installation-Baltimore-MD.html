<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Baltimore MD 21215</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
