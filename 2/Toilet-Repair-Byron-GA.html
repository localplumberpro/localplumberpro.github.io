<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Byron GA 31008</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
