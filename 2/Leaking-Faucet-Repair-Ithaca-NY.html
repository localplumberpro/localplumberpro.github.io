<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are simpler and less expensive to install as electrical power is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated correctly using vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
