<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Bowdon GA 30108</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
