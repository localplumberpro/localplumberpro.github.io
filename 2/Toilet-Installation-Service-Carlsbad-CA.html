<p>Numerous house owners will observe a clog and immediately reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical might get the job done, it's in fact quite harmful to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently utilize lye as the active ingredient. Lye is created to penetrate obstructions and dissolve them, but it also eats through your pipes and develops vulnerable points that are prone to burst.</p>

This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
