<p>Another essential question that you must ask yourself is how frequently you discover your house having plumbing problems. If you see that you are continuously faced with plumbing problems, then that is something that you may wish to take into fantastic consideration.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
