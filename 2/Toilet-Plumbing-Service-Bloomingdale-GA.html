<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
