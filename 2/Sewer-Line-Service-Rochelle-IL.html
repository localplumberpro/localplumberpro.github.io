<p>Safeguard your home from leakages. When you need a water heater replacement, there are numerous things that you need to think about to help you decide.

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
