<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
