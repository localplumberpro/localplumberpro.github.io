<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Valparaiso IN</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
