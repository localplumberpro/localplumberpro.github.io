When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
