<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
