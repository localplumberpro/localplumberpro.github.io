<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts.

Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by an adequately sized water system, which constitutes the 2nd major component of a supply of water system. With adequate tank capability to fulfill variable peak load need, the water supply source can supply a stable flow of water. During hours of low demand, the water circulation can be used to refill storage cisterns, tanks and towers, which then offer water for emergency usage and durations when demand exceeds the standard pumping rate. A water system source can take many forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
