<p>This post aims to attend to the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of complicated facts that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate.
