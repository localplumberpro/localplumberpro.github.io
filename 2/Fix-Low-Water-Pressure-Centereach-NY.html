For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place.
