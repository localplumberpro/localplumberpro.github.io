<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce weird sounds, however it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things worsen drastically for households with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
