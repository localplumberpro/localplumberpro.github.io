<p>Discover the right water softener for you. One typical way for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual homes, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in areas where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
