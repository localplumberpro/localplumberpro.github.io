<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Salem OR</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
