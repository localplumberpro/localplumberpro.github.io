<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
