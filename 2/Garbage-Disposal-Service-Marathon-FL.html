<p>Dry pipe systems normally are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience clogs in numerous drains at the same time in your home, then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
