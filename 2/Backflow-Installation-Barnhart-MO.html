<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
