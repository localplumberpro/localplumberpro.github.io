<p>Spotty meals? Some underground gutter drains end in the sewer system rather of at the edge of your backyard. In that case, step from the downspout to the nearby manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe.

Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
