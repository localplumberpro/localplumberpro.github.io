<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.

Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
