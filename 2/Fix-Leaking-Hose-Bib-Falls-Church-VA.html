The LADBS application should be submitted and paid for a minimum of two (2) business days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have actually gotten all other needed approvals or clearances from all other companies. Waste disposal unit can be made from either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is less expensive but more susceptible to leaking and deterioration. Stainless-steel blades are also more durable. People with a septic tank will need to consult the septic tank installer or producer to learn which waste disposal unit models are compatible with their system.</p>
<p>Before setting up, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount.
