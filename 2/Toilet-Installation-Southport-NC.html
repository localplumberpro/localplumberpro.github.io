<p>Hard water use might affect the performance of household appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, therefore impacting their performance.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing waste disposal unit, or excessive food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will generally suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the seriousness of the scenario.
