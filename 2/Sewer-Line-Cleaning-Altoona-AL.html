<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
