<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
