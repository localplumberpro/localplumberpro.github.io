<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to secure them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just get rid of as much building material as required to reach, remove, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can set up to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
