<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider.

<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still wise to bring in the specialists to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
