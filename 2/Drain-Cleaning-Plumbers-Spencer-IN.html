Without practical draining, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to costly water damage.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for appropriate grading to keep downward circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leaks. We check that the material used in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing lab. We prohibit cross connections between safe water and water from a doubtful source and forbid the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also inspect the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
