Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
