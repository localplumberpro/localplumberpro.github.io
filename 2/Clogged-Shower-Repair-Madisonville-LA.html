<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still happen.</p>
