<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Malverne NY 11565</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
