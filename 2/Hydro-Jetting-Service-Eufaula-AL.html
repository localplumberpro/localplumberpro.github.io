<p>Because 1980, backflow preventers have actually been lawfully mandated for particular buildings by the New york city Sanitary Code and the Guidelines of the City of New York City. The regulation was not strictly implemented until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that consists of routine random inspections of New York City structures to make sure they remain in compliance.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
