<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
