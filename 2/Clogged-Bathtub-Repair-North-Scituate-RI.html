Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule.
