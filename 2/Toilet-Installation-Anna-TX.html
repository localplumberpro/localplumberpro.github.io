<p>Next, acknowledge that unless your water is incredibly difficult, all the incoming water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry connections most likely should be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In many cases, you may desire to soften the hot water only.
