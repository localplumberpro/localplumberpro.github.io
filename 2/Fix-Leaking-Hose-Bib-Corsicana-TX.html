<p>Finally, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

The majority of apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor companies. Programs generally last four to 5 years and require apprentices to finish a particular variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
