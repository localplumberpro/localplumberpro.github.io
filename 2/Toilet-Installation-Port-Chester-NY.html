<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
