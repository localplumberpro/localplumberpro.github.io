<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
