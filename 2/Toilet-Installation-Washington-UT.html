<p>Any home appliance that uses water, from small coffee pots to large fridges, functions more effectively in a home with softened water.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be remedied easily if the clog is shallow and easy.

As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
