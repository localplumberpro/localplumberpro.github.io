<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are considered a health hazard. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place must be indicated on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and after that each year.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
