<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are considered a health hazard. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place must be indicated on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and after that each year.</p>

Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
