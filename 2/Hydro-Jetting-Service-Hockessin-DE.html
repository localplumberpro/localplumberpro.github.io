Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>If you want it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation requires to be brought out by a professional plumber. It is a fairly easy device that sucks food scraps down into a barbed grinder ring that rotates at high speeds, which pulverizes the scraps. They pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of when they are small enough. If you have a duel drain setup, it typically takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.
