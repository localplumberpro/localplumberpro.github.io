<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

Another good trick is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
