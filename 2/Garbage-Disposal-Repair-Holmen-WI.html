Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
