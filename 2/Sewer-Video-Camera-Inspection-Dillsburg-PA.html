<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
