<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
