<p>Bought happy medium stainless-steel blade design available at Lowes. Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approximate. 1 hour work for 2 men. There are several reasons you may need to call a plumber to come to your home and unclog drains. No matter what the cause of your issue, our drain cleaning company experts will take care of you as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's ended up being frustrating, or just for a make over? How about for a building addition or significant remodel? As soon as once again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's normally better to hire an experienced sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation involves over a dozen actions, and removing the old one includes much more operations. It can be hard matching up cut outs and component holes, and getting the brand-new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
