<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Lemon Grove CA</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
