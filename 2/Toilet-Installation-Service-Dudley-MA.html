<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
