Scale deposits likewise collect to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence affecting their efficiency.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
