<p>Leakages are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

In the beginning, these little deposits are safe, however over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
