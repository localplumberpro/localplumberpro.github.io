This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the unusual noises originating from your sink.</p>

The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
