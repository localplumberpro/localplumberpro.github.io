<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Company in The Dalles</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the water pipes in the house and around the home - they will help to determine the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
