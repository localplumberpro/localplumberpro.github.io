<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
