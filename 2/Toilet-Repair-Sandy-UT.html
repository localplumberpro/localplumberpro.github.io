A gas leak can result in a fire, and even an explosion, or trigger physical stress on the body that leads to headaches, tiredness, dizziness, inflammation to eyes and throat, chest pains, ringing in the ears, nosebleeds, and more. In fact, Carbon Monoxide poisoning is a common effect of neglected gas line repair tasks. Beyond physical harm, gas line leaks can also cause extreme damage to your pipes, implying more of your hard-earned cash invested in repairs.</p>
