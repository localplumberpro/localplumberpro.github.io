A gas leak can have almost immediate results on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the house and call us immediately if you have actually got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
<p>Particles such as foreign things - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become lodged in between your drainpipe and your pipes.
