If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have an idea of where your lateral lies. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the locations to prevent. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to identify.</p>
