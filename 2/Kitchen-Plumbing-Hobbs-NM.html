<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
