During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
