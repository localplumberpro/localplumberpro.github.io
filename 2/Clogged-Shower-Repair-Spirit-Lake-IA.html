<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology prior to we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet turned off, appropriately located test dicks, and the necessary components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each component can even more be broken down into its parts. For example a first check is a component. A part can even more be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make components, and parts are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
