<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leakages.
