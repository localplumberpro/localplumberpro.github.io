<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
