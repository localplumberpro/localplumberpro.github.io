When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "typical," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water going into the drinkable water distribution system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
