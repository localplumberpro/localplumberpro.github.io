<p>It doesn't always indicate they need to be changed if your pipes are older than these guidelines.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
