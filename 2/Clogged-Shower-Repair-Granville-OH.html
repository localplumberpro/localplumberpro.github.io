<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Granville OH</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
