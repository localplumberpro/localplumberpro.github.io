<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in West Warwick RI 02893</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
