<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
