<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
