<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location.
