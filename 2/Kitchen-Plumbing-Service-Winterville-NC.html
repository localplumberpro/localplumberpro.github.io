<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your home. This can take place in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
