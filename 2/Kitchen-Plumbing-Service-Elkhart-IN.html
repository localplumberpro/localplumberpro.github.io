<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it might wreak undesirable problems on your property. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>At Peoples, our goal is to preserve safe, reliable natural gas service for our consumers. We are actively keeping an eye on the unique coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak worldwide and in the U.S. We are working carefully with the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention and the local health authorities to continually keep an eye on the situation and assess our functional reaction plans.</p>
