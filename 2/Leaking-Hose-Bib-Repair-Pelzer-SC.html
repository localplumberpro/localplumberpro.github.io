<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Normally, minerals arrive because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water until it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium.
