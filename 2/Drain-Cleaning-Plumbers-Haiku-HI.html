For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
