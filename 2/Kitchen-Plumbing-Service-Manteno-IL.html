<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
