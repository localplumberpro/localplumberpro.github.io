<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Magnolia TX 77354</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
