<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to several kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from deterioration and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your house. This may not require totally repiping your home, given that newer products may have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
