<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more breakable and susceptible to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Particular pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and strains as an outcome of temperature level change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
