<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

Because they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
