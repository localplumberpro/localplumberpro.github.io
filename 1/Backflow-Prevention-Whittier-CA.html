<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
