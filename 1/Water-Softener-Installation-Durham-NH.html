<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Many backflow preventers are created to allow the elements to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary most of the times. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to facilitate a repair. Knowing the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
