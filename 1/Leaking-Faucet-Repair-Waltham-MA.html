<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
