Summer is usually a greater demand period than winter season considering that individual consumption of water increases with garden, heat and yard irrigation, leisure swimming pools, etc</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
