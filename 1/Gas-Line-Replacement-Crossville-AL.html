More difficult materials, like eggshells and fish bones, scour the disposal walls and help keep them clean too.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
