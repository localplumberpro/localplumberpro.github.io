<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be corrected easily if the blockage is shallow and easy.

As a bathroom drain is likewise harder to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
