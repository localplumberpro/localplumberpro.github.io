<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Dobbs Ferry NY</h3>
<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>
