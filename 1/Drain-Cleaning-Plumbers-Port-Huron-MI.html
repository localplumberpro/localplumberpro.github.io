If your house is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The broad variation in price is because of the size of your home, the sort of pipe you're installing, and extra repairs you find you need to make any time you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill may remain in the $300 range.
