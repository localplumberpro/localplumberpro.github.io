If you see that your plumbing struggles with many obstructions, leaks, and water pressure fluctuation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you must consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution.

Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
