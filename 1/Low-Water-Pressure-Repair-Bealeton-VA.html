<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Bealeton VA 22712</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
