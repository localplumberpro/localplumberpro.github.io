<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground gutter drains end in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your backyard. Because case, step from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and utilize an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe.

When no other source of a leak can be determined, it is safe to assume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to unscrew the drain, and clean it thoroughly. Remove all of the previous plumber's putty by using a scraper if it is set in place.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
