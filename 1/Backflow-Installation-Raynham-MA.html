<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in Raynham MA 02767</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
