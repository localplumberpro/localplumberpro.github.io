<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
