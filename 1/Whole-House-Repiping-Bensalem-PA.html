<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
