<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from deterioration and might put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your home.
