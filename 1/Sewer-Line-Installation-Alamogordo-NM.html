<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
