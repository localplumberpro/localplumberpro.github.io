<h3>Hose Bib Repair in Burlington Iowa</h2>

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
