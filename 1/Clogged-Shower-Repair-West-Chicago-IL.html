<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies should be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee proper backflow prevention is in location to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing tip notice one month before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak many people out a little, which is totally easy to understand. No one wishes to unintentionally break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, most of toilet repairs are basic and straightforward jobs - such as changing a used flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most common concern we run into concerning toilet repair is how to discover the best parts for your toilet. Often this is simple, and often it's not. Mostly it's easy though.</p>

Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the green and blue spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>When speaking about garbage disposal, some people may question what the huge deal is, specifically those property owners who have never ever owned an in-sink garbage disposal system before.
