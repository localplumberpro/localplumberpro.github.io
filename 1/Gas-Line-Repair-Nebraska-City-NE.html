<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Nebraska City NE</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
