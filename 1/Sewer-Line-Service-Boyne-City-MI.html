<p>Some hot water heater problems are small enough to be effectively addressed with professional repairs. Things like a dark pilot light, tripped breaker, broken burner, or sediment buildup are all fairly economical and simple to deal with. Nevertheless, particular concerns with your hot water heater might suggest that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can assist you determine which course of action is best for you.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
