<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages.

When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
