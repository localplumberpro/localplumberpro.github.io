<p>Set up 40 gallon electric hot water heater and thermal expansion tank.

Clogged Toilet: For toilets that are badly clogged, we will snake the drain to eliminate it once and for all.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I discover that numerous old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Will also say something does not work well merely due to the fact that they do not like the innovation and not because it does not work. If this heater is set up in a home with numerous bathrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
