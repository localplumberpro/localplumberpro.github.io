<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to get rid of little areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to finish. Don't worry, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other belongings so that our work doesn't make a mess. After the entire procedure is ended up and your home is tidied up, we'll test to ensure that water is streaming effectively through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to secure them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only get rid of as much building material as essential to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. If you want, you can organize to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
