But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned.

That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
