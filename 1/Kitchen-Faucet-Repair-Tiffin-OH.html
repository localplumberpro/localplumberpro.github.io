<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
