Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find one of the same shape and size.
