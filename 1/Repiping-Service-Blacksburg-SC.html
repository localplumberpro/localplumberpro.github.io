<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly choice.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great location to begin searching for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the wetness most.</p>
