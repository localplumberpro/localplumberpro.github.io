<h3>Sewer Clean Out in El Dorado Hills California</h2>
<p>Many house owners will discover a clog and instantly reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical may do the job, it's in fact quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners often use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is developed to penetrate clogs and dissolve them, but it also eats through your pipes and develops weak points that are susceptible to burst.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will usually suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
