<p>Replaced 50 gallon electric water heater, thermal growth tank, and pressure regulator valve. When many people consider plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe problems. The gas plumber will have a license that states he or she is licensed to work on and install gas lines. Homeowners must think about whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which signifies a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess. They, just like each person we've come across with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and extremely experienced. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either large or small task plumbing work.</p>
