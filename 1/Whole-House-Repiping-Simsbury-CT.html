<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can develop noise. If your energy expenses are rising, a brand-new, greater effectiveness water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing hard water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new location and put there.</p>
