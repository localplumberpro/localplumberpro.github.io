<p>When a large adequate source of water has been determined and examined, the third significant element of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. A lot of large cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
