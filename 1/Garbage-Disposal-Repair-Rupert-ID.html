<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing.

Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and may place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home.
