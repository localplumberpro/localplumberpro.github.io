<p>If you have a dishwasher, or wish to get one down the line, then make certain the garbage disposal you put in has an accessory for this. This is a perfect version as waste from the dishwasher can wash straight into the disposal system. Even if you do not have need for a dishwasher, if your home ever alters hands, brand-new owners may value the option.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
