<p>Secure your house from leaks. There are a number of things that you ought to consider to help you choose when you need a hot water heater replacement.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in good shape.</p>
