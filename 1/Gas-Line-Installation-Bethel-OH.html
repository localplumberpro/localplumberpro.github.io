When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced gradually. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures.
