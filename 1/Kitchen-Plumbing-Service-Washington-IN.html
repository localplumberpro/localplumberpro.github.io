<p>Ensuring plumbing devices such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are separated to their own respective networks is necessary in order to protect potable water safety. Having a plumbing inspection is pretty basic when purchasing a home or flat. If it's a leasing I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Once again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be one of the most expensive repair jobs if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you might need all of your water piping replaced. Again, very pricey. This is simply one of lots of issues that can crop up.</p>
