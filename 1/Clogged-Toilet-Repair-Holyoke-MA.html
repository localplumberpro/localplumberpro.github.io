<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation. On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber. The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include products or parts. Costs depend upon the precise repair needed, where you live, working with a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Retail prices for home water softeners may vary from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and kind of softener.
