The predetermined number represents the quantity of time between each regrowth. For instance, a lower selected number suggests your softener will regenerate less often.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET used by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
