<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.
