<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
