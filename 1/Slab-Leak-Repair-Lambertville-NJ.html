<p>It doesn't always indicate they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards. Well-maintained pipes might last longer, and improperly kept ones or those in areas with tough water (suggesting it has high mineral material), might fail earlier, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>The typical time to install or replace a garbage disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour. The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will cause your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or nasty odor to it. When the piping in your home starts to show any of these indications of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system.</p>
