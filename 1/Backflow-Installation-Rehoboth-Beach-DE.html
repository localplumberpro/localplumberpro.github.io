<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
