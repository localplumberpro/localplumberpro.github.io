<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place.

<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances.
