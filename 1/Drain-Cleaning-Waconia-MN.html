In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has actually ended up being a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages indicate your toilet no longer has actually the power required to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>

However very first connect the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and look for leaks. If you discover any problems, leaving the bolts uncut until you have actually done these final checks lets you easily get rid of and reset the toilet.</p>
