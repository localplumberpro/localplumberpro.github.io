<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
