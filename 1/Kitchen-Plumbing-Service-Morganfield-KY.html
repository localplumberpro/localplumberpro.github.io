<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
