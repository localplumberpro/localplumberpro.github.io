Improved effectiveness also means that you'll take pleasure in a reduction in your energy bills, as your devices will not need to work harder or utilize more water in order to work at their best.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher performance hot water heater can bring them back down.

After that the softener can be detached, moved to its brand-new place and put there.</p>
