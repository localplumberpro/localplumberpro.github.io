<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
