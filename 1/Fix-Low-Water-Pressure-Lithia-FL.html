<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Lithia FL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
