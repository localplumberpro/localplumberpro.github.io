<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Newberg OR</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains.

Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
