<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to eliminate little areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to finish. Do not fret, while we're working on your home we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other valuables so that our work doesn't make a mess.

<p>The normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
