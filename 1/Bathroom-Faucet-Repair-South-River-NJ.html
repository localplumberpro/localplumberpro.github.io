They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater.

<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house. Usually, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
