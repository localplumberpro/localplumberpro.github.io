<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable service, especially when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
