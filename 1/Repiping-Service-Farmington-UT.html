<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to secure them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only remove as much building product as necessary to reach, detach, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. If you wish, you can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
