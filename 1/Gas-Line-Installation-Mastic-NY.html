This is simply one of many issues that can turn up.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a quick fix in the short-term, it can cause far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
