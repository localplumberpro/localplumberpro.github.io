<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
