<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
