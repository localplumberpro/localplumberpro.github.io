Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
