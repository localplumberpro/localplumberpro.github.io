<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

<p>Understand that a lot of types of disposals need a switch nearby to the sink to control the outlet-- the electrical expert must wire for this, too. Note: Batch-feed disposers do not need a switch due to the fact that they start when you insert and turn an unique drain plug. The function of the plumbing code is to insure the correct installation of systems for providing drinkable water, for hygienic sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to insure public security, health, and welfare insofar as impacted by the installation of plumbing.</p>
