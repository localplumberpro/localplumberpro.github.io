Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
