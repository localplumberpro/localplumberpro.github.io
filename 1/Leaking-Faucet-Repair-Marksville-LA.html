<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, similar to everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either small or big job plumbing work.</p>
