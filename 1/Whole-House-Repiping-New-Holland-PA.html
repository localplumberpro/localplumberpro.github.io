<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me New Holland PA</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service might appear like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice?

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
