Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
