I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
