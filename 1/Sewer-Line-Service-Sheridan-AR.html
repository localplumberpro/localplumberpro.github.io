<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Sheridan AR 72150</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
