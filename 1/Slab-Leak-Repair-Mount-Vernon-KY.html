<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Mount Vernon KY 40456</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system.
