<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation visit. Installing natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the cured water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>The cost of installation depends on a number of variables, consisting of the kind of hot water heater and your current plumbing configuration.
