<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to likewise be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and harden or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten up the drain locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 various events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, similar to each person we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very knowledgeable. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone requiring either little or big task plumbing work.</p>
