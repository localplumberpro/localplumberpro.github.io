<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
