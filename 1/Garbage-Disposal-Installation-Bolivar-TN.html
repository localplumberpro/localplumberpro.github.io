<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
