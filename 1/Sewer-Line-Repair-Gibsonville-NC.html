<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
