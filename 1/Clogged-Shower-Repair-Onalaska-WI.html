Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
