<p>The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>From below the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and re-install locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
