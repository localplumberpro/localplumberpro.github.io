<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
