<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to analyze.

The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be eliminated fairly easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices.

Master plumbers shall not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take undue advantage of an unwary public.</p>
