<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller sized private service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, home buildings, businesses and shops. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches.

<p>Given that the pipes are much easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your budget enables, we can resolve other locations of the home and slowly replace all of the pipes over a period of time, instead of all at once.
