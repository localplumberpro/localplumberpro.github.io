<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller sized private service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, home buildings, businesses and shops. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water gets in the consumer center through a water meter that tapes circulation rates and water usage for billing purposes. Individual service pipelines are typically made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>

<p>Given that the pipes are much easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your budget enables, we can resolve other locations of the home and slowly replace all of the pipes over a period of time, instead of all at once.

<p>Some of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain.

Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>Occasionally sharpening the blades. To clean and sharpen the blades, all you need to do is grind a few ice cubes in the disposal before running cold water through the system. 3. DO treat your waste disposal unit once a month by spraying a 1/2 cup of baking powder down the drain, then pouring in a 1/2 cup of vinegar. The mix will bubble and fizz for a bit as it cleans up the disposal.</p>
