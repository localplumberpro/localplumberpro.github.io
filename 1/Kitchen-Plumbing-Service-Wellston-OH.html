<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
