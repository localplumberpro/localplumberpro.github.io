<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex clinical procedure, however simple to remedy. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals found in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
