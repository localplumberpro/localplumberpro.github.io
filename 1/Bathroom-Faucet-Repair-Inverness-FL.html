<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology in Inverness FL 34452</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments consist of specialized camera equipment that runs into your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more palatable than trenching through the yard if you have actually identified pooling water in the lawn. This will cost you (on average) between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are awarded to plumbers who have held a journey license for a certain amount of time, and have actually built up the required hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber also needs to pass a state approved test.</p>
