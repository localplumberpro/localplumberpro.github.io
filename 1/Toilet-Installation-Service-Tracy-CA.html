Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
