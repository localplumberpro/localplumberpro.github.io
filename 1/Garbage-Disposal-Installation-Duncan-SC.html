<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Duncan SC</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Also called cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains. This approach works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as sinks and showers. Backflow is the circulation of water in the incorrect direction from a customer's water system into the general public water system.
