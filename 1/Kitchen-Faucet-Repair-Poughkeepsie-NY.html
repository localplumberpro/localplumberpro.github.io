<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair, maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing professionals. Backflow prevention gadgets operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a building or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
