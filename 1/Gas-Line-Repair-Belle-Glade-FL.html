<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Belle Glade FL</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
