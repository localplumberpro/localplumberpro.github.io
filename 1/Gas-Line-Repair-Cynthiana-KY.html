Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide.

If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
