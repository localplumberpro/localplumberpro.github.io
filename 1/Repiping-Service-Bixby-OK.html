<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
