<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However finding the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
