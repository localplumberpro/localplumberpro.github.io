<p>Building regulations can differ from city to city, but all serve the very same purpose. The extensive list of provisions and guidelines list the minimum requirements for the design and construction of a residential or commercial  building. Buildings that don't stick to local code are thought about risky and are in need of an upgrade. In serious cases, it's much better to destroy old structures instead of spending the time and cash on pricey repairs or replacements.</p>
