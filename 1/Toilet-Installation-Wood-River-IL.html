<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. In time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
