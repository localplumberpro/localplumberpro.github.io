<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
