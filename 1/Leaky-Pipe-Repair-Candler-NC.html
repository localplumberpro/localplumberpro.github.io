<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
<p>Supplying affordable, efficient, quality water softening solutions is very crucial at Kel Tren WaterCare.
