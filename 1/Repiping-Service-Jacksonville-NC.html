<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from deterioration and might position toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.
