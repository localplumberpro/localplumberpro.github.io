<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Corrosion can actually eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or change the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of rust on a metal alloy should be assessed to identify if the part is usable or must be replaced.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
