<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
