<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Atlantic Highlands NJ</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>In cold environments, water, soil or waste pipes must not be installed beyond a home, in exterior walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other place subjected to freezing temperature level unless some provisions are made to secure it from freezing by insulation or heat.
