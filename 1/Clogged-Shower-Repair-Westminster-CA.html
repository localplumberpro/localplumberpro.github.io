Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the marketplace-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>

We extremely recommend repiping your home during spring or summer so you do not have to stress about freezing temperatures during the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
