Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
