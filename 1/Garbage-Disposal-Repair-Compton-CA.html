Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
