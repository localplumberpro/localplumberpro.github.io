Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be supplied.</p>
