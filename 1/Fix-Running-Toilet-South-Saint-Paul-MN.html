A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow.
