<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
