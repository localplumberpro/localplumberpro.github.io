<p>Leakages are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
