<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Dorr MI 49323</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
