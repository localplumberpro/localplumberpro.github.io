Recent advances in toilet technology have actually made modern-day bathrooms even more comfy and functional. If your toilet was produced before 1994, then it's likely costing you cash every day. New toilets utilize almost 2 gallons less per flush while offering the exact same or better flushing power as their outdated counterparts. Jeff Gorton, an editor at The Household Handyman, will show you how to remove and dispose of a water heater in our video tutorial.

<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is designed to bring in corrosion-causing components in the water, assisting to prevent the steel tank from wearing away. The best way to avoid drain blockages is to view what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are rusting.

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
