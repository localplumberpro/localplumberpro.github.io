<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it might wreak unwanted issues on your home. A house's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
