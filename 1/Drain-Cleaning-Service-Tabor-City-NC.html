<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed.

<h3>Laundry Room Plumbing in Tabor City North Carolina</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to get rid of chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>When it comes to drains, an ounce of prevention deserves a pound of cure. To put it simply, taking specific safety measures and executing clever practices such as setting up hair guards, only flushing soft, little food particles down your garbage disposal, and never using your toilet or drain as a wastebasket can help you avoid most drain clogs and keep your plumbing operating efficiently.</p>
