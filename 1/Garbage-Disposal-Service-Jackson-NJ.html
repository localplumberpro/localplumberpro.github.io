<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exclusions in Area 106.2.2 shall apply to small repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings other than Group R-3 occupancies, a license and inspection will be needed for more substantial work if more than 10-percent (small) of a floor level, wing, or area is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (small) of the overall structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages fixed and couldn't be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really experienced, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>Our bathroom and kitchen sinks are something we take for given up until they start acting up. And it just so happens that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start breaking down at the most troublesome times, like when we're having more than supper guests, or when we're running late for work in the morning. If you're aiming to minimize energy expenses and would like warm water as needed, think about a tankless hot water heater. These units need less maintenance and last longer (over 20 years) than the traditional hot water heater.</p>
<p>Testing need to be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should possess a valid, current plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
