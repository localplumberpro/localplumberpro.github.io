<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
