<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
