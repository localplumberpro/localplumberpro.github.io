He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another appointment.
