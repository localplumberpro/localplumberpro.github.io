When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
