This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
