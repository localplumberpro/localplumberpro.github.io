Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines checked. Some plumbers might get professional discount rates from merchants or kitchen and bath showrooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their expenses with what you can find online or in the house enhancement stores. They might be getting you a better offer</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leakages.
