<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Houston TX</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the support of a professional. Some small blockages can be looked after with a plunger and typically, when the toilet will not stop running, it's an easy matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, certain problems do require an experienced plumber, and it's important to know the difference to avoid lost disappointment, time, and cash.</p>
