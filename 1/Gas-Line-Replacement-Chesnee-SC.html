<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
