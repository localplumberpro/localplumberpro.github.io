Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
