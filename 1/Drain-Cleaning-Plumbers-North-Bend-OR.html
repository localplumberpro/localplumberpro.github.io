<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
