During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
