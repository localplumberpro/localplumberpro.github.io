<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Rancho Palos Verdes CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
