<p>Swimming pools of septic waste. One of the more apparent outdoor signs is if you can see sewage pooling in your yard. If your lawn smells foul and there's a puddle that simply won't go away, the problem might be a broken main sewer line. The garbage disposal is leaking: This is brought on by a worn-out hose or seal. We'll thoroughly inspect your system to find the problem and perform the essential repair.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your house successfully remove large amounts of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other small particles can get caught and build up in your pipes. Ultimately, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting.

<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first try pouring BioSmart (offered at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inaccessible or insufficient cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time. House owners and plumbers should be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this occurs. Buildings without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at risk of a pipe rupturing.</p>
