<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Perry IA 50220</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the overall costs. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
