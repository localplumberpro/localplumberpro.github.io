<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Allen TX 75002</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
