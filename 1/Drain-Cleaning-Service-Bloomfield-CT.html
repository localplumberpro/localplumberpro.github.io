Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

A water system source can take lots of forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, man-made or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
