Maintenance requirements are minimal, however it does pay to have the system checked for appropriate operation frequently.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
