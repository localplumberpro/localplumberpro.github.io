<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwelcome problems on your residential or commercial property.

In many cases, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
