<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
