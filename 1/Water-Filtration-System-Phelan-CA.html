<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
