<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
