<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Halifax MA 02338</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and break or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
