<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Swansea MA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
