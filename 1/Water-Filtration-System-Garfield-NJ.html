<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
