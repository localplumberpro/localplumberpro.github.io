Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
