<p>Picture living in a house with soft water-- a house where you don't have unusual movies on your meals or mirrors, can lather soap quickly, and do not need to fret about scaling on the within or outside of your appliances. Sounds great, does not it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for homes, you can.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific procedure, but easy to fix. It utilizes salt to get rid of minerals and smells found in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
