They should be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
