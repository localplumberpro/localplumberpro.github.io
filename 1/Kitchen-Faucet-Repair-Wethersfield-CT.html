<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Wethersfield CT</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule.
