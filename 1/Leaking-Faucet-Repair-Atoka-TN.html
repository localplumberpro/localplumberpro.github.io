<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.

The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
