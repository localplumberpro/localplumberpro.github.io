<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
