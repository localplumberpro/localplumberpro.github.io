<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a customer on a custom-made home, they will work directly with the property owner when it concerns choosing faucets and other fixtures. As a subcontractor, those choices may have already been made. We have developed a group of contractors we have actually worked for in the past, and this has resulted in some business that has not included competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
