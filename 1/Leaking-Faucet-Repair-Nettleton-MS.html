Linking irrigation to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City ordinance hold that no watering system may be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may just be filled with safe and clean water. Water which has actually gone into a watering system is not drinkable.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater.
