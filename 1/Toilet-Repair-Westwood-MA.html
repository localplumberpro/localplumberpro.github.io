<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Westwood MA 02090</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
