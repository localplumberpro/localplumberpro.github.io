<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
