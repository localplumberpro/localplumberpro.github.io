<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
