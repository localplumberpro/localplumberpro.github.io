<p>Without a water softener, laundry needs additional detergent to prevent it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher spotted and stained. Cloudy scum develops on your shower drapes and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in hard water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair sticky and lifeless.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
