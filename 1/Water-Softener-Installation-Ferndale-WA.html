<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Ferndale WA 98248?</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
