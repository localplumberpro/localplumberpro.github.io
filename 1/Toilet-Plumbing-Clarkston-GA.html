Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance.

The thermal growth requires to get away, hence the need for an expansion tank to assist regulate the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out.
