<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Repiping is merely installing all brand-new incoming water lines to replace an old failing system. Most people repipe because they have actually duplicated leaks in their galvanized pipes, slab leakages from copper pipes in the concrete floor or leaks that have caused damage to their house.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.</p>
