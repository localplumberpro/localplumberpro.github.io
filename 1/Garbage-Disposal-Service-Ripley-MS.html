<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers must be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only viable alternative.</p>
