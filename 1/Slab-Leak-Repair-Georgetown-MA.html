<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and wore away parts make repairs expensive and hard, meaning a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of the Plumbing Division is to perform cross connection inspections to identify safe and clean water supply that are in need of being protected from contaminates. The cross connection control program is needed by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399. A-Tex Plumbing will aid with any kind of emergency toilet repair, drain cleaning or replacement that you could need in your home or workplace.</p>
