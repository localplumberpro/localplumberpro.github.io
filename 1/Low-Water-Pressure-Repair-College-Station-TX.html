Your home's main gutter system gathers rainwater from the roofing line and controls its path down the house to ground; however the water could still puddle next to the foundation. That's where underground rain gutter drains are practical. They connect to the downspouts on your home and move water away from the foundation underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a procedure used to clear debris from the side rain gutter pipes on your house.</p>

Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
