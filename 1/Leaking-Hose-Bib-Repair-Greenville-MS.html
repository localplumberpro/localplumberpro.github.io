<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Greenville MS 38701</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing created to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011.

Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are appropriately evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
