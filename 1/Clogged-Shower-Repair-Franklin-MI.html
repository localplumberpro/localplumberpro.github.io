<p>Remember that a price quote check out does not obligate you to choose that company. Call out the next company if the plumber that comes out provides you the heebie-jeebies or seems unprofessional. You're searching for a company that you can place on speed dial for any plumbing issue, so it needs to be a company of people that you have a great, strong feeling about.</p>
<p>As soon as you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
