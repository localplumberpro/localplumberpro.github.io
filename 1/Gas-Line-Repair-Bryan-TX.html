If your showers become disappointing, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
