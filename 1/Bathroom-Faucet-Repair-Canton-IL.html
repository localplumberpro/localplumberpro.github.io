<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In homes with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
