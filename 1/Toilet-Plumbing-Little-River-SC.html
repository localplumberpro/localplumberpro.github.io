<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again essential for the repair service technician to be aware of the firmness of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not damaging. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to minimize any scale growth or rust.

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
