<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Waseca MN 56093!</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions.
