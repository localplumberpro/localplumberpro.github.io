<p>If you have a dishwasher, or want to get one down the line, then make sure the garbage disposal you put in has an accessory for this. This is an ideal version as waste from the dishwasher can clean straight into the disposal system. Even if you don't have need for a dishwasher, if your home ever alters hands, brand-new owners might appreciate the option.</p>

The site will be cleaned up and restored to its previous elegance if the leak is effectively fixed.</p>
