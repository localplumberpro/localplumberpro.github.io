<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust certification standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and corroded parts make repairs pricey and tough, implying a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
