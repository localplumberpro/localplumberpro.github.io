<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>
