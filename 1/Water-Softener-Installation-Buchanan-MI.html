<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Local laws require yearly inspections to ensure your backflow prevention gadgets are working as they must be since water contamination could present a serious public health threat. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear over time and it's important that they receivethe exact same regular maintenance that your car or HVAC system gets to ensure your household's water is clean & safe.</p>
