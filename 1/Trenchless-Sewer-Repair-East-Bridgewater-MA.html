The most popular and traditional design of water heaters in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electric tank unit. These units store just the right amount of warm water for your convenience. A tankless water heater would be best if you are looking to save more energy and lower your water expense because it only warms water, as you use it not when you do not.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require slightly various actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
