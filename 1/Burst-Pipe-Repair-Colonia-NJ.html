<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in numerous parts of the plumbing system, the majority of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow issues and even stop a fixture from flowing altogether. The next typical issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it minimizes the offered volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
