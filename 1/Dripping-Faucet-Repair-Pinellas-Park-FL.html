<p>Replacing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
