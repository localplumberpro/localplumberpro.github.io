Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>List prices for home water softeners might vary from around $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and kind of softener. Softeners are ranked by the overall variety of grains the unit can eliminate before being charged.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
