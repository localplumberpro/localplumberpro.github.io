<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
