<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
