<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
