<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, hair, or debris paper? After years of usage, drains can collect destructive accumulation. This accumulation obstructs water circulation, eventually backing up your drains up until they are unusable. Usually, all the pipes need is a great scrubbing.

Do not be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they merely stand for female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you purchase the parts, do not hesitate to ask for help. Then screw all the gas line parts together to ensure they fit.</p>
<p>The easiest solution may seem to be just ignoring the issue or using a do it yourself chemical service. However, this is a short-term fix and may trigger more damage. Some pipe materials, like copper or cast-iron, are sensitive to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can wear away and erode your pipes, causing major leakages, fractures, and large damages.</p>
