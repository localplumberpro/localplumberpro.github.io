<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
