<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
