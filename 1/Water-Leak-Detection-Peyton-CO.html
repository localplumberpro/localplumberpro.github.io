<p>More than typically, small leaks in our houses are easily fixed through welding and we disregard it as a petty problem. However if the leak problems are frequent and every once in a while some or the other corner of your house has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to inspect the whole piping system to perform home repiping. Several leakages shouldn't be ignored at all; else it may lead to complex flooding concern soon.</p>
