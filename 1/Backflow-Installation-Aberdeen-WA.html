Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it.
