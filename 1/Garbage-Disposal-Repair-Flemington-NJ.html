<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should likewise be supplied.</p>
