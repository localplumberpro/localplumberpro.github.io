<h3>Plumbing Company Serving South Richmond Hill NY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is a relatively affordable plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your warm water heater. Fill up the sink with water and touch a facial tissue between the bottom of the kitchen sink drain and the sink. If the tissue gets any water, you have actually got a leaky basket strainer and it's time to learn how to get rid of a sink drain. If your gas line has actually passed its helpful age, then it's time to replace the lines. And when you need brand-new gas lines installed, there is just one company to call in Western Michigan - Service Professor.
