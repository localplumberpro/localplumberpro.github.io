<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at New Boston TX 75570?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
