<p>Detach the waste line. Eliminate the "P" trap waste line running from the disposal by utilizing a wrench to loosen the slip-nut linking the disposal to the trap. You might want to position a container under the trap to capture any wastewater being in the bottom. Routine maintenance can help avoid hot water heater failure and extend the life of your devices. In addition to repairs and new equipment installation, we offer regular preventative maintenance for water heaters.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
