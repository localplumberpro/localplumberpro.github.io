<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
