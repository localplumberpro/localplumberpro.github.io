For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow backwards into the drinkable water system.
