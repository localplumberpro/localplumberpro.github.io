<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can produce sound. If your energy expenses are increasing, a brand-new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling tough water to flow to the storage tank and household taps.
