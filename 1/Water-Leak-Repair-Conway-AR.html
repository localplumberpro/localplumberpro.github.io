<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are thought about a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be shown on building strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>
