Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
