<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to remove.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen appliance in many homes today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
