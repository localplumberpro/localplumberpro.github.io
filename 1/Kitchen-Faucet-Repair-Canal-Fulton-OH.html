<p>Call us today to learn more about our drain services. We're readily available for same-day consultations! Our group is standing by at (800) 259-7705. Roll plumber's putty between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and cover it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening. Press the kitchen sink strainer firmly down into the putty, include the rubber gasket, friction ring and locknut under the sink, and retighten the locknut.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
