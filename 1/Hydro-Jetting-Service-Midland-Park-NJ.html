<p>As soon as the FutureSoft water softener system is installed, depending upon the age of your home and the plumbing will depend on what you will see. It could a couple of weeks to completely repipe your whole house if you have a huge home and don't employ sufficient contractors. We highly recommend repiping your house throughout spring or summertime so you don't have to worry about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping procedure if you live in a cold-weather environment.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.</p>
