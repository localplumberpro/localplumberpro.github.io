<p>Two styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but works against back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers prevent backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are properly checked by certified personnel.</p>
