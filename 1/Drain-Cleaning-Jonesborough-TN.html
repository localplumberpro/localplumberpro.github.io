<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Jonesborough TN 37659!</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific process, but easy to treat. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that connect and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
