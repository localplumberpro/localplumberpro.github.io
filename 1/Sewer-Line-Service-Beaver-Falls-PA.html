Worn out and wore away parts make repairs expensive and tough, meaning a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
