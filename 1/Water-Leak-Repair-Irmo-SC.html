<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts changed with initial factory parts.
