<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need.

The cost is roughly the same for setting up a propane gas line from the tank to your house as the cost to have gas go to your home. Find out which kind of gas your house currently has. Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, however gradually they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The extremely poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot).
