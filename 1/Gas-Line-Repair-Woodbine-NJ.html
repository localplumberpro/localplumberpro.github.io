Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011.

Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are correctly evaluated by qualified personnel.</p>
