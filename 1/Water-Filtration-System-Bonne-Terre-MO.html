<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Bonne Terre MO 63628</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
