<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Frankenmuth MI</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing components in your home? Water pressure in the house resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be regulated to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is FAR MORE affordable than mold removal or changing floor covering or drywall! So we advise installing or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your entire house.</p>
