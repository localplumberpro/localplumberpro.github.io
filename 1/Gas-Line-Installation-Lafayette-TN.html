Backflow prevention devices operate by allowing water to stream in only one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow backwards into the potable water supply.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
