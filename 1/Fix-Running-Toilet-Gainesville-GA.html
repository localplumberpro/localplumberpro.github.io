<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
