<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Ardmore OK</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be treated easily if the blockage is shallow and simple.

As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
