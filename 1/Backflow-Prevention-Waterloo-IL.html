You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the exact same thing, but without the zinc finish.

This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they may also need an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing generally requires an examination or work experience or both.

<p>The normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
