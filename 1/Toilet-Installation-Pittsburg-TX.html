In this case, two electric heating components controlled by individual thermostats are accountable for heating the water inside the tank.</p>

<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
