<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Arcanum OH</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
