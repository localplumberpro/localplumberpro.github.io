<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters need to be able to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
