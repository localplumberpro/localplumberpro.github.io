<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc finishing.

This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
