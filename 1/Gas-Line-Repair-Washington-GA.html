<p>Inspecting the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be serious problem. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house need to have water.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
