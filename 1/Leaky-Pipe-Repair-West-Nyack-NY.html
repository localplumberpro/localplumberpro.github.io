<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to versatile rubber traps. Debris can easily catch in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not supply required assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
