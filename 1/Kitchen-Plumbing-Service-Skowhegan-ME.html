<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>We are trained in laying plumbing and linking it so that it is water tight. You want your plumbing done right to prevent severe leaks and rust in the future. Our group is happy to utilize high-quality materials for results that last, and we are so confident in our services that we offer a three-year guarantee on practically all jobs.
