<p>It is essential to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
