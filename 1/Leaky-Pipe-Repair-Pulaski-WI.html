<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-lasting solution.</p>

Rather, our service technicians utilize a breaking tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair technique is generally utilized to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>
